          <p>Howdy Partners, and <b>Welcome</b> to my personal website where I get to talk about myself!</p>
          <p>I believe that being honest with others and with yourself is one of the most important characteristics a person should have. So let me start by saying that I have not and will never claim to have been a Computer Science enthusiast my whole life. I purely got into this field of study out of high school because I had an affinity for video games. Looking back, I know that my reasons were naive and shallow even, but after attending my first Computer Science course I quickly realized that I was very far removed from understanding even the basics of the field. It was a frustrating and disparaging realization, but I had to choose whether I would continue or give it upâ€¦ and well here I am. Many years later I have been able to take a genuine interest the complexities of this field. I look forward to overcoming new topics and challenges. Even though it can still be daunting to learn a new language or framework from scratch, it is always a <b>KICK ASS FEELING</b> to see progress and improvements with what I know how to do and what I can accomplish with that knowledge. </p>
